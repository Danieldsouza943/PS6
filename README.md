## Description
The RandWriter project is a tool for generating random text using a Markov model. It analyzes the statistical patterns of a given input text to construct a Markov model of a specified order. This model is then used to produce new text that closely mimics the style and structure of the input text.

### Features
  1) Markov Model: The program builds a Markov model of a specified order based on the input text. The model's order determines how many preceding characters are considered when predicting the next character in the sequence.

  2) Stream Operator Overload: The program implements an overload for the stream insertion operator (<<), allowing it to display the internal state of the Markov model. This includes details such as the model's order, alphabet, and the frequencies of k-grams and k+1-grams.

  3) Text Generation: With the constructed Markov model, the program generates new text of a user-defined length. The generated text captures and reflects the style and patterns of the input text.

  4) Testing: Comprehensive unit tests are included to verify the program's accuracy and functionality and ensure that all components work as intended as well as verify that text generation matches expected patterns

### Testing
My tests ensure that the implementation functions correctly across various scenarios:
  1) Order 0 Model Validation: Verifies that the implementation works accurately for a Markov model of order 0, where each character is predicted independently based on its overall frequency in the input text.

  2) Method Functionality: Confirms that the orderK method correctly returns the model's order and that the freq methods accurately compute:

      a)The frequency of a given k-gram.
      b)The frequency of a character following a specified k-gram, provided a valid input string.

  3)Text Generation Distribution: Checks that the text generated by the program adheres to the expected statistical distribution derived from the model, ensuring randomness while reflecting the input text's characteristics

### Lambda
The lambda function I implemented accumulates the total frequency for a given k-gram by iterating over all possible characters that can follow it. This ensures that the cumulative frequency accurately represents the total occurrences of the k-gram in the input text, facilitating the generation of random characters with probabilities proportional to their observed frequencies..

### Issues
I did not come across any issues that I could not fix in time. Initially, the implementation used two separate maps to manage frequency data: one for tracking the occurrences of k-grams and another for the frequencies of characters following each k-gram. To improve efficiency and simplify I later modified the code to work with only one map for both frequencies.

Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.
